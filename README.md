# ProtocolOrientedProgramming

Practiced protocol oriented programming with basic geometery and shapes example. Performed the tasks first with OOP and then with POP. 
Learned about dispatch for classes which are objects with vTable and dispatch for value types which are objects with witness table.
We can conform ANY types to protocols which saves us a lot of code repitition and gives us better composability.
In the end practiced retroactive modeling.
